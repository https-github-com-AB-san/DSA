OOPs - Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
Basic concepts of OOPs -
-   Object - An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible).
-   Class - A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
-   Inheritance - **Inheritance in Java** is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
-   Polymorphism -  If a [class](https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java) has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as **Method Overloading**    ....... 
-   Abstraction -
-   Encapsulation
