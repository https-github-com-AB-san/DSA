OOPs - Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
Basic concepts of OOPs -
-   Object - An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible).
-   Class - A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
-   Inheritance - **Inheritance in Java** is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
-   Polymorphism -  If a [class](https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java) has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as **Method Overloading**    ....... If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as **method overriding in Java**.
-   Abstraction - **Abstraction** is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. A class which is declared as abstract is known as an **abstract class**. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

-   Encapsulation
